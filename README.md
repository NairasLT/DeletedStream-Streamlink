Downloads selected YT/DLIVE streamer if streaming and auto-uploads to youtube.

I Created this app because certain youtube / dlive streamers delete thier livestreams the minute they end the stream, so its lost forever
it also auto-uploads to youtube so it dosent take up space on your hard drive, but there's a disatvantige uploading already low bitrate
live stream etc livestream optimized for Ultra-low latency, uploading it again it even more decreases the bitrate because youtube compresses 
the stream even more, to not take a lot of space on thier servers.

TODO:
  Autodelete after certain time? (Should be pretty easy)
